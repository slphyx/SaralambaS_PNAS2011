# SaralambaS_PNAS2011

A model for the dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in an infected patient during treatment with artesunate monotherapy. The original model (https://www.pnas.org/content/108/1/397) was written in Wolfram Language but in this repo, it was rewritten in Stan (https://mc-stan.org/).

## to run the model
- open runFixedRing16.R to run and fit the model with the (fake) data.
